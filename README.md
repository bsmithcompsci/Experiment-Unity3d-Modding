# Experiment-Unity3d-Modding
Experiment on how to get ease of access to modding capabilities to a Unity3D game.

---
## Objective
The objective of this experiment is to create a modding ease-of-access for the user. Essentially meaning that a user can open Unity3d and import the SDK into an empty project. Then start configuring and setting up their modded scenes, vehicles, weapons or whatever the game exposes to the modder.

## TL;DR What This Modding SDK Supports
The modding sdk utilizes Addressables, thus allowing for performant real-time asset streaming.
